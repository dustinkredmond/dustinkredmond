### Thanks for visiting

I'm a self-taught software developer currently working in a
non-developer role at work. 


I primarily enjoy writing tools and libraries for developers, though I've authored several desktop applications for
non-technical users as well.

A few of the things I'm currently working on:

- A minimalistic Java-based ORM framework for SQLite ([LiteORM](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/LiteORM#readme))
- A web-based UI to allow running Groovy scripts on a schedule ([GroovyServer](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/GroovyServer#readme))
- A JavaFX based cross-platform clipboard history manager that looks great on Linux and MacOS ([ClipBoard++](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/ClipBoardPlusPlus#readme))
- An abstraction of the AWT System Tray Icon for JavaFX, since JavaFX is missing this functionality natively ([FXTrayIcon](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/FXTrayIcon#readme))
- A cross-platform GitHub Gist desktop client with syntax highlighting and code completion ([GistFX](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/GistFX#readme))
- A desktop client to easily create/modify API routes in real time based on the Spark Java micro-framework. ([SparkFX](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/sparkfx#readme))

**A non-exhaustive list of languages I like to work in:**

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Java
- Groovy
- Python
- C#
- C/C++
- SQL and PL/SQL
- Human Languages (in order of most to least proficient)
  - English
  - Spanish
  - French
  - German
