### Thanks for visiting

I'm a self-taught developer.
I enjoy working on cultivating developer tools as well as desktop applications.
I love back end development, and like to get my hands dirty with occasional front end development as well.

A few of the things I'm currently working on:

- An implementation of the System Tray Icon for JavaFX applications, JavaFX doesn't support this, so someone had to write it ([FXTrayIcon](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/FXTrayIcon#readme))
- Library for **easily** displaying input/alert dialogs in JavaFX programs ([FXAlert](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/FXAlert))
- A minimalistic pure Java non-ORM framework for SQLite. Kick those database relations to the side, while still using a SQLite database for storage. Great for testing or scaffolding. ([LiteORM](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/LiteORM#readme))
- A multi user web-based application to let users run Groovy scripts either on demand or on a schedule. Great for simple or complex scripts, automate tasks with easy script definitions. Run scripts daily, hourly, each minute, or use a cron expression for even more customizability. ([GroovyServer](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/GroovyServer#readme))
- A clipboard history manager that looks great on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Why send your data to Microsoft or other remote organizations when you can store and access it locally? Forget accidentally copying over clipboard data. With ClipBoard++, your clipboard history is **always** available. ([ClipBoard++](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/ClipBoardPlusPlus#readme))
- A cross-platform GitHub Gist desktop client. Think of it as Notepad or TextEdit backed by GitHub's cloud infrastructure. ([GistFX](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/GistFX#readme))
- A desktop client to easily create/modify web API routes in real time based on the Spark Java framework. Users of Express JS will love the familiarity this application provides. ([SparkFX](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/sparkfx#readme))
- And countless other tools that don't yet merit public repos...
