### Thanks for visiting

I'm a self-taught developer.
I enjoy creating developer tools as well as desktop applications.
I love back end development, and like to get my hands dirty with occasional front end development as well.

A few of the things I'm currently working on:

- An implementation of the System Tray Icon for JavaFX applications, JavaFX doesn't support this, so someone had to write it ([FXTrayIcon](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/FXTrayIcon#readme))
- Library for **easily** displaying input/alert dialogs in JavaFX programs ([FXAlert](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/FXAlert))
- A minimalistic pure Java non-ORM framework for SQLite. Kick those database relations to the side, while still using a SQLite database for storage. Great for testing or scaffolding. ([LiteORM](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/LiteORM#readme))
- A multi user web-based application to let users run Groovy scripts either on demand or on a schedule. Great for simple or complex scripts, automate tasks with easy script definitions. Run scripts daily, hourly, each minute, or use a cron expression for even more customizability. ([GroovyServer](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/GroovyServer#readme))
- A cross-platform GitHub Gist desktop client. Think of it as Notepad or TextEdit backed by GitHub's cloud infrastructure. ([GistFX](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/GistFX#readme))
- A desktop client to easily create/modify web API routes in real time based on the Spark Java framework. Users of Express JS will love the familiarity this application provides. ([SparkFX](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/sparkfx#readme))
