### Thanks for visiting

I'm a self-taught software developer currently working in a
non-developer role at work. I've been writing code since I was 13 years old; I got my start using the LAMPP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl).


I usually find myself hacking together some neat little tool here and there, and I fancy
applications that do one job really well. I actively contribute to open-source and enjoy
being able to help fix a bug or create a feature wherever I can.

A few of the things I'm currently working on:

- A Java-based ORM framework for MySQL focused on minimalism ([ReflectDB](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/ReflectDB))
- A web-based UI to allow running Groovy scripts on a schedule ([GroovyServer](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/GroovyServer))
- A JavaFX based cross-platform clipboard history manager that looks great on Linux and MacOS ([ClipBoard++](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/ClipBoardPlusPlus))
- An abstraction of the AWT System Tray Icon for JavaFX, since JavaFX is missing this functionality natively ([FXTrayIcon](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/FXTrayIcon))
- A smattering of microservices and utility applications for various small tasks

**A non-exhaustive list of technologies that I regularly use:**
