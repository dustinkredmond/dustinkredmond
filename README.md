### Thanks for visiting

I'm a self-taught software developer currently working in a
non-developer role at work. 


I primarily enjoy writing tools and libraries for developers, though I've authored several desktop applications for
non-technical users as well.

A few of the things I'm currently working on:

- An implementation of the System Tray Icon for JavaFX applications, JavaFX doesn't support this, so someone had to write it ([FXTrayIcon](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/FXTrayIcon#readme))
- Library for ***easily*** displaying input/alert dialogs in JavaFX programs ([FXAlert](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/FXAlert))
- A minimalistic pure Java non-ORM framework for SQLite. Kick those database relations to the side, while still using a SQLite database for storage. Great for testing or scaffolding. ([LiteORM](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/LiteORM#readme))
- A multi user web-based application to let users run Groovy scripts either on demand or on a schedule. Great for simple or complex scripts, automate tasks with easy script definitions run daily, hourly, each minute, or use a cron expression for even more customizability. ([GroovyServer](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/GroovyServer#readme))
- A clipboard history manager that looks great on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Why send your data to Microsoft or other remote organizations when you can store and access it locally? Forget accidentally copying over clipboard data. With ClipBoard++, your clipboard history is **always** available. ([ClipBoard++](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/ClipBoardPlusPlus#readme))
- A cross-platform GitHub Gist desktop client. Think of it as Notepad or TextEdit backed by GitHub's cloud infrastructure. ([GistFX](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/GistFX#readme))
- A desktop client to easily create/modify web API routes in real time based on the Spark Java framework. Users of Express JS will love the familiarity this application provides. ([SparkFX](https://github.com/dustinkredmond/sparkfx#readme))
